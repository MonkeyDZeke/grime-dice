# Digital Grime Dice Playground

If you don't know what Grime Dice are, check out these links:

* [The original article explaining what they are and the math behind them](http://singingbanana.com/dice/article.htm)
* [Where you can buy the physical ones on Maths Gear](https://mathsgear.co.uk/products/non-transitive-grime-dice)
* [The Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontransitive_dice#Grime_dice)

My idea here is to create a place where you can simulate your own combinations of different sets of Grime Dice with a fun interface. So have fun!
